# Movie Search and Favourites App

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based movie search and favourites application. It allows users to search for movies, add them to a list of favourites, and view detailed information about individual movies. The application has three main components: the Home Page, the Movie Page, and the My Favourite Movies Page.

## Features

### Home Page
- **Search Movies:** Users can search for movies by typing in a search box. The search results update in real-time as the user types, providing a dynamic and responsive search experience.
- **Favourite Button:** Each movie in the search results has a "Favourite" button. Clicking this button adds the movie to the user's "Movies Favourite" list.
- **Movie Details:** Clicking on a search result opens a new page with more detailed information about that movie.

### Movie Page
- **Movie Information:** This page displays comprehensive information about the selected movie, including its name, poster, plot summary, and other details.
  
### My Favourite Movies Page
- **Favourites List:** This page shows all the movies that the user has marked as favourites. The list is persistent, meaning it remains unchanged even after closing or refreshing the browser.
- **Remove from Favourites:** Each movie in the favourites list has a "Remove from Favourites" button, allowing users to remove movies from their list.

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend Framework:** This application uses a frontend framework like HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **Movie Data Source:** The movie data is retrieved from a third-party API, such as the OMDb API.
- **Local Storage:** To maintain the favourites list persistently, the application uses local storage in the browser.
